# PhotonForge

PhotonForge is a physically-based Monte Carlo renderer written in C++. It supports both **path tracing** and **photon mapping**, simulating realistic lighting effects like soft shadows, indirect illumination, color bleeding, and caustics. Designed to be modular, fast, and educational.

---

## 🚧 Features (in Progress)

- ✅ Path tracing (unbiased global illumination)
- ✅ Photon mapping (two-pass caustic + indirect light system)
- ✅ Hybrid mode: path tracing + photon lookup
- ✅ Physically-based materials: Diffuse, Specular, Cook-Torrance
- ✅ Acceleration structures (BVH, KD-Tree)
- ✅ Outputs `.ppm` image format for easy testing and debugging
- ✅ Multi-threaded CPU Support
