# PhotonForge

PhotonForge is a physically-based Monte Carlo renderer written in C++. It supports both **path tracing** and **photon mapping**, simulating realistic lighting effects like soft shadows, indirect illumination, color bleeding, and caustics. Designed to be modular, fast, and educational.

---

## 🚧 Features (in Progress)

- 🚧 Path tracing (unbiased global illumination)
- 🚧 Photon mapping (two-pass caustic + indirect light system)
- 🚧 Hybrid mode: path tracing + photon lookup
- 🚧 Physically-based materials: Diffuse, Specular, Cook-Torrance
- 🚧 Acceleration structures (BVH, KD-Tree)
- 🚧 Outputs `.ppm` image format for easy testing and debugging
- 🚧 CLI support for different render modes and configs
